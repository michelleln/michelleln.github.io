I'm older than Katniss Everdeen and Harry Potter,  
in most of the books  
and Hazel Green Lancaster and Percy Jackson and Laura Jean Covey  
and every YA protagonist I used to love as a girl  
or still love to this day  
I'm older than main characters and I have done absolutely nothing extraordinary  
half of them die but at least they've got a story  
my escape used to exist between the pages of novels  
until I became too ancient to be the hero  
when I was 12 I used to wish I was 16  
because didn't it seem interesting  
fighting to death and casting spells and stealing lightning  
and sending out love letters?  
my phone is so dry you could use it as a sponge  
and my heart is so empty you could fill it up with a teardrop  
I am 19 and already I look in the mirror and see a blank canvas  
where wrinkles will crease my skin  
I must be a failure cause I've never learned to shoot a bow and arrow  
and Hazel's boyfriend lit up like a tree  
but at least she's felt love:  
she's got something on me  
I'm 17 - why do I already feel irreversibly incomplete  
these characters are frozen at their ripe young ages  
and I feel like I'm folding into old dusty pages  
am I invisible now?  
am I no longer interesting?  
I'm still learning to live well  
but in books I've missed everything  
do the authors age them?  
make them act older than they seem?  
or am I just behind and too late to rethink?
